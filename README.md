## Technologies Used

- [x] HTML

## Description

_This project creates an application that intakes user input and runs it through branching logic to calculate the cost of a pizza. This cost is then displayed to the user on the HTML page. This is my fourth individual project at Epicodus and uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery._

| It should calculate a total based on user input and return that total upon user click of "add to order".  | $(".order-total").text(pizzaPrice); | $22  |
| It should display pizza size and toppings alongside total upon user click of "add to order"  | $(".order-total").text(pizzaPrice); | Pizza Size: medium, Pizza Toppings: Pepperoni, $22  |
